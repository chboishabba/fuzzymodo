# Fuzzymodo (Scaffold)

Implementation scaffold for the selector DSL and norm-constraint execution
pipeline discussed in `OSS-Fuzz Bug Detection`.

## Layout
- `src/selector_dsl/`: parser, canonicalization, and evaluation stubs.
- `tests/`: fixture-driven smoke tests for schema and canonicalization.

## Current Status
Scaffold only. Contracts are defined in `docs/planning/fuzzymodo/`.
